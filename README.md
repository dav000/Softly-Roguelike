# Softly-Roguelike
Softly Into the Night: a sci-fi, dystopian roguelike with Lovecraftian & survival elements, built from the ground up using Python 3/tcod/esper. Turn-based, grid-based, procedurally-generated, ASCII UI, w/ versatile Entity Component System. Currently in development by Jacob Wharton. 

Repository includes some of my modules that may be useful for roguelike devs, such as OrangIO, a user-interface system built on TCOD that supports complex key bindings, text input, dialogue boxes, menus, and more. *That said, I cannot guarantee the utility of any of the software presented here; it is shared solely for the purposes of education and recreation.*

How to play:

Make sure you have Python (anything version 3.7 or later should work) installed on your computer. Download this repository. Run main.py with Python 3 in directory Softly-Roguelike.

NOTE: this game is a WIP (Work In Progress) and it is far from representing its final state. *The game is currently in an unplayable state as far as actual gameplay and is in a test-heavy version!!*
