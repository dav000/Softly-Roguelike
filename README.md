# Softly-Roguelike

*Introduction*

Softly Into the Night: a sci-fi, dystopian roguelike with Lovecraftian & survival elements, built from the ground up using Python 3/tcod/esper. Turn-based, grid-based, procedurally-generated, ASCII UI, w/ versatile Entity Component System. Currently in development by Jacob Wharton. 

Repository includes some of my modules that may be useful for roguelike devs, such as OrangIO, a user-interface system built on TCOD that supports complex key bindings, text input, dialogue boxes, menus, and more. *That said, I cannot guarantee the utility of any of the software presented here; it is shared solely for the purposes of education and recreation.*
