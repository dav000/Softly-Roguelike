# Softly-Roguelike
Softly Into the Night: a sci-fi, dystopian roguelike with Lovecraftian & survival elements, built from the ground up using Python 3/tcod/esper. Turn-based, grid-based, procedurally-generated, ASCII UI, w/ versatile Entity Component System. Currently in development by Jacob Wharton. Repository includes some of my modules that may be useful for roguelike devs, such as OrangIO, a user-interface system built on TCOD that supports complex key bindings, text input, dialogue boxes, menus, and more.
