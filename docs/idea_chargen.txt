BODY TYPES
Choose your body type:

All different heights incur a penalty for wielding things fit for people of a different height
Same goes for equipping gear but the penalty is more severe; cannot wear things 2 or more height classes away from your own

Note: there is virtually no difference between the items of various sizes, except the Size value or component (how should it be implemented?)
	but when you equip it you get a penalty if it's the wrong size or can't equip it.
	However there is one difference: giant gear is more expensive (150%) and dwarf gear is less expensive (80%). This may be implemented on-the-fly rather than stored as changed data in the object itself (just record the size of the object).

In order that they appear in the menu to choose your body type:

maybe the AV change is gained only by the increase / decrease in fat? Like no explicit change in AV but indirectly it changes AV by ++fat or --fat
	Same for Msp change, this is caused by reduction in fat (?)
		And DV (?)
	Is this complicating things too far? Nah, it's not that big a deal to just put the logic for fat amount affecting AV in _update_stats()... It works on a logarithmic scale, so every 4 or 5 times bigger/smaller only changes it by +1 or -1.
		
		# AV calculation function from fat amount (x)
		if x > 100:
			while x / 4 >= 100:
				x = x / 4
				av += 1
		elif x < 100:
			while x * 4 <= 100:
				x = x * 4
				av -= 1
		# Msp calculation function from fat amount (x)
		if x > 100:
			while x / (11/10) >= 100:
				x = x / (11/10)
				msp += 1
		elif x < 100:
			while x * (11/10) <= 100:
				x = x * (11/10)
				msp -= 1
		
Regardless these are the values it should have
