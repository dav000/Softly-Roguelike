idea to send commands optionally using full text.

Command examples:

(c) First, some simple commands with one or two words.
>>move nw
	move northwest, do not move if not possible
	(do not auto-attack or perform any commands automatically).
>>nw
	same as the command "y" or northwest. Move nw and automatically perform any context-sensitive commands like auto-attacking, opening doors, picking up items (if that option is on), etc.
>>attack n
	try to attack north of your location.
	if nothing is there to attack, you still attack the air and waste your AP.
	(this command can be used to attack things the player knows are there but the character cannot sense i.e. invisible enemies)
	
(b) More complex commands:
>>equip t on head
	"on" and "head" are keywords
	all body parts have a keyword: head, back, body, mainhand, offhand, ammo
		some have multiple keywords:
			ammo = quiver = ammunition
			mainhand = main hand
			offhand = off hand
			body = torso
>>equip a in offhand
	"in" is also acceptable

(c) These commands all do the same thing (assuming the main hand has nothing equipped currently):
>>equip a in hand
	defaults to the mainhand if the mainhand is empty.
>>equip a on mainhand
	on and in are identical (interchangeable) keywords.
>>equip a in main hand
	mainhand and main hand (two words) are identical keywords/phrases.

(d) This command has many arguments:
>>craft 16 t-shirt with f using auto
	command = craft, followed by its arguments.
		craft X item with components using tools
		with and using are keywords that indicate the next part of the command.
	name of the result is followed by the quantity.
	f is an inventory item representing a parcel of cloth (quantity 20).
		if you wrote "with auto" it would automatically pick components to use.
	auto selects the tool automatically when you write "using auto".
		could write "using r t" to use inventory items r and t as tools
