	stat mods:
		mass -10%
quirky
	affects: everything
	item is designed badly/strangely or has some minor damage that makes it difficult to use without understanding the "quirk," in other words you must be skilled in this particular instance of gear in order to avoid a penalty to stats
	Skill for individual instances of weapons is a binary value, either you know the weapon or you don't. This is stored in a component InstanceSkill which is only used for the player character. No need to have it for NPCs as you'd never know the difference anyway.
	stat mods: (assuming you are not skilled in this instance)
		Atk -1
		Dfn -1
		Pro -1
		Gra -1
