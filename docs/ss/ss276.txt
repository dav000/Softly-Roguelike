Softly Into the Night

This week, I continued to get everything working with the new ECS system including all the hundreds of new items. The past couple of days I have been focused on just getting the game to run again; I'm to the point where the entire character generation phase works, and I'm feeling very close.

Again, I have plans to release Softly at the end of this year, though that may be pushed back a couple months as needed since I am very busy with school, etc.

Edit: earlier today I managed to get the game to run with no errors! But, the player still couldn't see and the whole screen was black. Unfortunately I won't be able to do much more work on the game until tonight, and then I will try to get that fixed, too. Getting sooo close.
