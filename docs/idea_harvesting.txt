carcass harvesting:
	like native Americans, we can harvest many useful parts from almost every part of an animal. It bothers me in games when you harvest a carcass and get one useful piece from the WHOLE animal. In reality you'd get a large array of supplies from a standard size animal:
		muscle, 4-32 (harvest to get pieces/chunks of flesh and sinew)
		sinew, 1-6
		scrap flesh, 8-64
		parcel of flesh, 2-16
		animal fat, 4-32
		heart, 1 (nutritious, high in protein)
		liver, 1 (nutritious, high in minerals)
		brain, 1 (nutritious, high in fat)
		bladder, 1 (waterproof bag)
		rawhide, 1 (or fur? harvest to get leather hide)
		bone, 2 (standard sized animals)
		parcel of bone, 5
		skull, 1
		antlers, 1-2 (for deer-like animals)
	Large animals would drop much more supplies, and some unique supplies:
		bone, large, 2-4 (large animals only)
carcass can become a mangled carcass if it gets damaged in a crude way.
Likewise if you kill a thing in a brutal way, it drops a mangled carcass.
mangled carcass: provides significantly less materials than a carcass (50%).
If you further damage a mangled carcass, it turns into the raw materials, but obviously with greatly reduced yield (10%).
