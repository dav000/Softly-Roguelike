welding is a separate skill from metalworking.


information about welding:

braze welding:
	lowest level (weakest weld / cheapest)
	use a metal like bronze, aluminum etc. that acts like a glue when heated
	oxygen propane torch is sufficient to heat the filler (is it called that?)
	generally easier to do
	
gas welding (oxy / acetylene torch welding):
	use a filler metal with other hand
	no electricity required
	old-style welding
	
welding machine
	can perform most types of welding
	
arc welding:
	good efficient type of welding, just requires electricity
	Stick, TIG, MIG, Flux Core

Stick welding:
	easy to do
	very effective
	requires flux/electrode stick
	only works on certain metals like iron/steel
	can be used anywhere (even underwater)
	dangerous

TIG
	use a filler metal
	most precise
