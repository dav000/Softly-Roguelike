    IDEA: Offhand equipping / attacking, and how to handle it.
        When you equip weapon in offhand, you get DV, AV, protection, Msp, Asp,
            but you do NOT get Acc, Dam, or Pen stat mods.
        When you attack with offhand weapon, what we do in code is:
            * automatically unequip the mainhand weapon
                (storing it in temporary variable)
            * unequip the offhand weapon
            * equip the offhand weapon in your mainhand
				* with a -25% penalty to combat effectiveness (Atk,Pen,Dmg)
            * attack normally
            * unequip the mainhand weapon
				* remove the penalty to combat effectiveness
            * equip that back into your offhand
            * re-equip your original mainhand weapon (temp var)
