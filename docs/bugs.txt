	In general, make persuasion slightly less effective. Gaining disp. too easy without any speech skill whatsoever or any stats at all.
		Of course I was A compatibility when getting easy disp. Maybe compatbility is too big of a factor.
	likes/dislikes matter too much.
	pester : result in loss of disp. Anger up
	beg : disp. down a lot
	Bribery : disp down
	Taunt : disp down, anger up
	interrogate : reaction down
	charm : small change but adds charmed status
	boast : small change but adds charmed status
	torture : reaction down (if didn't already do it)
	Limits on how high each type of persuasion can go
	
	
BAD BUGS: 

glitches:
	- flirt error no dialogue to draw from (bubbly personality 250 disp)
	- introduction didn't happen when first talking to ent
	- enemy whipmaster moving VERY slowly
	- throw no longer working
	- randomness in the tilemap render function (needs to be handled elsewhere!!!)
	- throw weapon -> player dies (while no weapon is equipped??) (may have been fixed)
	

	- pick up item on same tile as you -> you disappear
	- corpse attacking you (last attack of dying entity results in message that the corpse attacked you)
	
	
FIXED:
	- duplication of items
