BAD BUGS: 

glitches:
	- enemy whipmaster moving VERY slowly
	- throw no longer working
	- randomness in the tilemap render function (needs to be handled elsewhere!!!)
	- throw weapon -> player dies (while no weapon is equipped??) (may have been fixed)
	

	- pick up item on same tile as you -> you disappear
	- corpse attacking you (last attack of dying entity results in message that the corpse attacked you)
	
	
FIXED:
	- duplication of items
