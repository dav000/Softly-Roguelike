BAD BUGS: 
	- sometimes: 
		monster won't move
			- AI of entities only running for 1 turn before it stops forever...?
				but not if it attacks you...????
				never happens when you are overencumbered and moving at 1 msp....
			- AI may just be taking a very long time between movements (>100 turns)... but why?
		doesn't equip weapon (can't replicate?????)

glitches:
	- throw weapon -> player dies (while no weapon is equipped??) (may have been fixed)
	

	- pick up item on same tile as you -> you disappear
	- corpse attacking you (last attack of dying entity results in message that the corpse attacked you)
	
	
FIXED:
	- duplication of items
