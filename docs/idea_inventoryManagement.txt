inventory is one thing
capacity for carrying items, liquids, molten metal, etc. is determined by how many bags, bottles, pots, etc.
basically abstract away inventory management of so many different container types

IDEA:
Capacity for carrying an item in general depends on its carrying type
This is only for carrying, not for wielding
	swords require scabbards to carry
	


wielding vs. equipping (this may be too complex...)
	certain weapons/ammo require certain types of containers to equip (scabbards for swords, quivers for bows, ammo pouches for cartridges, etc.)
	wielding does not require any special container
	advantage of equipping: it takes much less time to wield an equipped weapon than to rummage through your inventory and then wield it.
