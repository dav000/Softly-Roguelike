combat



conditional stat modifiers
	applied under specific conditions relative between the combatants, during combat
	For instance: If you are significantly taller or more massive than the one you're fighting or vice versa, then these modifiers apply. The degree to which they apply depends on how different the stats are (logarithmic (base 2?) function -- diff of 1x -> 1 stat point; diff of 2x -> 2 stat points; diff of 4x -> 3 stat points, etc. Where x == some value like 6cm for height and 2kg for mass)
	Taller:
		Atk +
		Dfn -
		Pen +
		Pro -
		Gra -
	Shorter:
		Atk -
		Dfn +
		Pen -
		Pro +
		Gra +
	More massive:
		Gra +
	Less massive:
		Gra -
	



combat skills

How Stats are affected by skill in a weapon:
	At 0 skill, Stamina cost of attacking w/ weapon is 2000% of the weapon's stamina cost. At 100 skill it's 100% (no extra penalty).
	Atk is +0 at 0 skill. At 100 you have +50 (each 2 skill pts = +1 Atk)
	Dmg x1 -> x2 of weapon damage.
	Pen +0 -> +20
	DV +0 -> +20
	AV x1 -> x2
	Pro +0 -> +20
	Gra +0 -> +20
	ASp +0 -> +200 (+2 for each 1 skill pt)
	
	Msp penalty for large weapons you are unskilled in.
	



idea for dual wielding

if you wield two weapons you get a lot of penalties
	in addition to gaining no attack, dmg, pen from the offhand weapon and getting a penalty to other stats if you aren't wielding a shield/knife in offhand, 
	by wielding 2 weapons at all you incur a flat penalty of -2 Atk.
	
	
	NO!!!!! Instead you just get the (already implemented) BONUS for wielding a 1-h weapon in 2 hands.
	
	
STANCES
	stance changes stats
	
	idea for shields
		effectiveness of shields vs. ranged attacks can be improved by changing stance.
	
	
	

Penetration
	6 higher - cut AV in half
	12 higher - cut AV to 0
	18 higher - critical hit*
	*critical hit: do full damage + 33% of total HP of target.
		33% is default critical hit damage bonus.

knocking down
	If you have wrestling skill or strength, you can knock down foe.
	4 positions - standing, crouching (on knees), prone, supine
	crouching:
		Msp -50%
		AV -1
		Protection -2
	supine:
		Msp -90%
		AV -2
		Protection -3
	prone:
		Msp -90%
		AV -4
		Protection -4
