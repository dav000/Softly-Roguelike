How Stats are affected by skill in a weapon:
	At 0 skill, Stamina cost of attacking w/ weapon is 2000% of the weapon's stamina cost. At 100 skill it's 100% (no extra penalty).
	Atk is +0 at 0 skill. At 100 you have +50 (each 2 skill pts = +1 Atk)
	Dmg x1 -> x2 of weapon damage.
	Pen +0 -> +20
	DV +0 -> +20
	AV x1 -> x2
	Pro +0 -> +20
	Gra +0 -> +20
	ASp +0 -> +200 (+2 for each 1 skill pt)
	
	Msp penalty for large weapons you are unskilled in.
	



idea for dual wielding

if you wield two weapons you get a lot of penalties
	in addition to gaining no attack, dmg, pen from the offhand weapon and getting a penalty to other stats if you aren't wielding a shield/knife in offhand, 
	by wielding 2 weapons at all you incur a flat penalty of -2 Atk.
	
	
	NO!!!!! Instead you just get the (already implemented) BONUS for wielding a 1-h weapon in 2 hands.
	
	
STANCES
	stance changes stats
	
	idea for shields
		effectiveness of shields vs. ranged attacks can be improved by changing stance.
	
	
	

Penetration
	6 higher - cut AV in half
	12 higher - cut AV to 0
	18 higher - critical hit*
	*critical hit: do full damage + 33% of total HP of target.
		33% is default critical hit damage bonus.

knocking down
	If you have wrestling skill or strength, you can knock down foe.
	4 positions - standing, crouching (on knees), prone, supine
	crouching:
		Msp -50%
		AV -1
		Protection -2
	supine:
		Msp -90%
		AV -2
		Protection -3
	prone:
		Msp -90%
		AV -4
		Protection -4
