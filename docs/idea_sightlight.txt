Lights in general have higher light levels
Environment light (light that is present on every tile, such as sunlight / moonlight)


provided you have a sight sense component and aren't BLIND, you roll to see things:
	if (light_level >= C) and (vision + log2(light_level) >= d20 + camo + dist))
	where C == 1 if night_vision else 400
	
	20 + 20 >= d20 + 0 + 20m
	
	resulting value denotes how well you see the thing.
	x <= 0 			cannot see at all.
	0 < x <= 20		can see '?' and can see general type/shape/size of the thing (large creature, small shiny thing, etc.)
	20 < x <= 40	can identify the type of thing (sword, club, watch, bowl, humanoid, insectoid, etc.) (skill for gear, species for creatures)
	40 < x <= 60	can identify the specific class of thing and general stats (wooden sword, metal club, gold watch, clay bowl, whipmaster, scarab, etc.) (requires enough int to identify)
	60 < x			can accurately identify the exact stats of the thing (requires enough int to identify)
	
	
	note even at 0 vision you could still see something if the inequality holds true
	even negative vision values are (potentially) valid using this formula -- you would just only be able to really see in bright light like sunlight.
	
	note you can also identify things in other ways, like by touch alone.
	
	
Lowest light level you can see (w/o nvision): 	400 	(20^2)
Typical level of brightness of indoor area: 	1600 	(40^2)
Typical sunlight level of brightness: 			10000	(100^2)
	(this is the level of the environment brightness on each tile, and has nothing to do with
