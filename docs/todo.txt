How to fix slow Python:
	__slots__ - reduces RAM usage on objects
	Cython or Boost Python to embded C++ code
		Rust - alternative to Cython, Boost
	numpy/scipy - for dealing with arrays faster without loops

		
		
		
		EXAMPLES:
		
	menu:
		lowercase on top (rn capitals appear first)
		scrolling or some other method of showing large menus
			scrolling:
				Up/Down/PgUp/PgDown/Home/End, same as typical menu navigation
				clicking takes scrolling into account
				actual size of menu box never exceeds window height
					the items in the menu just scroll up and down
	like this:

				---------------------
	line 6 is now showing a new item, like 1 is obscured (obscuring two items at the top of the list), and every item has been moved up one tile. The top now shows "2 more" and the bottom shows "5 more" instead of "6 more" since only 5 more items remain below the visible portion of the menu. Notice the letters for each menu item DO NOT CHANGE so as to provide a pleasant scrolling experience.
