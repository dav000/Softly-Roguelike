	-- Type information --
	
	wooden sword:
	The wooden sword is a choice weapon for training in the art of swordsmanship, as it allows one to practice swordplay without any serious threat of harm to oneself or others. In actual combat, a wooden sword is vastly inferior to a proper steel blade.
	
	swords:
	Swords are very effective and versatile sidearms. They make useful cutting tools and machetes, and sometimes make good chopping implements, as well. In combat they are quick and agile weapons, highly effective against unarmored foes; but primarily, they are the ideal weapon for self-defense in terms of the amount of DV they provide their wielder.
	
	1-h weapon:
	One-handed weapons can be wielded in the hand as a melee weapon, or in two hands for improved offensive and defensive effectiveness.
